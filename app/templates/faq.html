<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3>Q: How can I remove my information from Yalies?</h3>
<p>Yalies only uses data that is already publicly available to Yale studentsâ€”absolutely no protected information is revealed. NetIDs, UPIs, and emails come from the <a href="https://directory.yale.edu">Yale Directory</a>, and everything else comes from <a href="https://students.yale.edu/facebook">Yale Face Book</a>.</p>
<p>Potentially sensitive information in the Face Book is automatically censored from Yalies. Ideally, Yale ought to hide this information from their sources by default. However, until such time as such a security change is made, students should consider hiding from Yale's database any information that makes them uncomfortable.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>To remove information about yourself from Yalies, visit the <a href="https://students.yale.edu/facebook/PreferencesPage" target="_blank">Yale Face Book "Edit" page</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>To access the page, first sign in to the Face Book with CAS.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The Face Book sometimes redirects users back to the home page upon sign in. If this occurs, click the "Edit" button in the header to return.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>On the Edit page, you'll see a number of "Yes" and "No" radio buttons, which each correspond to a data point Yale provides. Select the "No" option for any data point that you don't wish to be publicly accessible.</p>
        <img src="/static/images/hide/click_no.png" alt="Click No buttons">
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Click the "Update" button to save changes.</p>
        <img src="/static/images/hide/click_update.png" alt="Click Update button">
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Congratulations! Your information has been hidden.</p>
        <img src="/static/images/hide/success.png" alt="Successful save">
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Removed information will promptly disappear from both Yale's sources and from Yalies. Sensitive information such as street address, room numbers, and phone numbers are censored from the Yalies database regardless of presence in the Face Book.</p>
<h3>Q: How can I add a pronunciation for my name?</h3>
<p>Yalies draws name pronunciations from <a href="https://name-coach.com">NameCoach</a>, a third-party company that Yale uses to provide name pronunciations, plus additional information like phonetic spelling and pronouns. You can provide this information to Yale by visiting <a href="https://www.sis.yale.edu">Yale SIS</a> and selecting "Personal Data" then "NameCoach".</p>
